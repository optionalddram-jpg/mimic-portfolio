# mimic_ // Full-Stack Developer & Security Researcher

Based in **Tempe, AZ**, I am a Full-Stack Engineer specializing in **TypeScript** and **Next.js**. I am currently a student at **Persevere**, where I focus on building scalable, type-safe applications with a "Security First" mindset.

When I'm not architecting web apps, I hunt vulnerabilities on **Intigriti** and explore the low-level theory of system exploits.

## 🛡 Security Philosophy
I believe that **security is a feature, not an afterthought.** My experience in Bug Bounty hunting (XSS, IDOR, Logic Flaws) informs every line of TypeScript I write. I build applications that aren't just functional, but resilient.
